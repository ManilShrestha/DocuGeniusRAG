DocuGeniusRAG is a personal project designed to enhance document interaction by allowing users to ask questions about the content of a document directly. Utilizing advanced retrieval-augmented generation techniques, it intelligently extracts and synthesizes information from the document to provide relevant answers. This innovative approach transforms static document reading into an interactive experience, making it easier to obtain specific information and insights from lengthy documents or complex materials.
